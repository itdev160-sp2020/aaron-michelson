        Melitta coffee pods produce aromatic coffee with a smooth, rich flavor and are biodegradable.  Each pod is a pre-measured serving with 7 grams of premium coffee.  The pods are nitrogen flushed for maximum freshness.

          <p>Melitta coffee pods are great and so easy to make in the morning.  And they are biodegradable so I am helping to preserve the planet as well.</p>

        <h3>Greg J.</h3>
          <p>I use Melitta coffee pods with my two Hamilton Beach coffee makers; one at home in my small apartment and one in my cube at work.  They are great and much more affordable than buying a coffee everyday from the coffee shops.</p>

          <p>Melitta coffee pods are easy to make but I wish they came in more flavors than just Medium Roast and Dark Roast.</p>
